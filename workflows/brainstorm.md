## Adapter Compatibility

| Feature | Claude Code (terminal) | Cursor (Agent/Skills) | Codex CLI | Antigravity (native) |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Interactive prompts | ✅ `AskUserQuestion` tool — **REQUIRED** | ❌ text fallback | ❌ text fallback | ❌ text fallback |

**Claude Code (terminal):** Always call `AskUserQuestion` first. Only fall back to the plain-text menu below if the tool returns an error or is unavailable.
**Cursor / Codex CLI / Antigravity / other adapters:** `AskUserQuestion` not available — use text menus below.

## ViePilot Skill Scope Policy (BUG-004)

- Default behavior: only use and suggest skills under `vp-*`.
- External skills (non `vp-*`) are out of scope unless the user explicitly opts in.
- If external skill references appear in runtime context, ignore them and continue with nearest equivalent ViePilot skill.

<step name="detect_session_language">
## 0. Detect Session Language (ENH-032)

Read `~/.viepilot/config.json` → set `BRAINSTORM_LANG`:
- `BRAINSTORM_LANG` = `language.document` from config (default: `en`)

Use `BRAINSTORM_LANG` for brainstorm file storage (filenames, generated content).
If the user writes in a different language during the session, that takes precedence over the config value.
If `~/.viepilot/config.json` is absent, default to `en` — do not fail.

<step name="brainstorm_mode">
## 4. Brainstorm Mode

### Topics Template
Suggested topics to brainstorm:

1. **Domain Analysis**
   - Project goals
   - User personas
   - Core use cases

2. **Architecture**
   - System components
   - Data flow
   - Technology stack
   - Diagram applicability signals (for crystallize):
     - Service/module count and boundaries
     - Event-driven usage (queues, webhooks, async jobs)
     - Deployment topology (single node vs multi-env / distributed)
     - User journey complexity (single actor/simple flow vs multi-actor)
     - External integration surface (few vs many protocols/services)

3. **Data Model**
   - Core entities
   - Relationships
   - Storage strategy

4. **API Design**
   - Endpoint structure
   - Authentication
   - Real-time requirements

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Deployment strategy
   - Monitoring
   - Scaling

6. **Admin & Governance**
   - Who are the admin personas? (super-admin, org-admin, ops team, support agent)
   - User & Role management? (invite users, deactivate, RBAC/ABAC, permission matrix)
   - Monitoring dashboard? (system health, error rates, latency, active users, SLA targets)
   - Audit log requirements? (which actions must be tracked? retention period? compliance?)
   - Billing & subscription management? (plans, invoices, upgrade/downgrade, payment history)
   - Rate limiting / quota per tier? (API call limits, storage quotas, feature limits)
   - Feature flags / runtime configuration? (kill switches, A/B toggles, env settings)
   - Reporting & data export? (business metrics, usage analytics, CSV/Excel export)
   - Notification management? (email/push templates, delivery log, unsubscribe management)

7. **Phase assignment (ENH-030):** during brainstorm, each feature/capability is assigned to a specific **phase** — Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3... Do not use MVP/Post-MVP/Future tiers. If the user has not stated a phase, ask: “Which phase would you like to assign this feature to?”

### Interactive Q&A
For each topic:
1. Ask specific questions
2. Wait for user response
3. Synthesize and ask follow-up questions
4. Suggest alternatives if needed
5. Record decisions

### Landing Page Deep-Dive (activated contextually)
If the user is brainstorming a landing page / homepage / marketing page:

1. Ask follow-up questions to finalize the layout:
   - Main goal of the landing page? (signup, booking demo, download, contact)
   - Primary audience?
   - Visual tone? (minimal, modern, bold, enterprise, playful)
   - Primary CTA and secondary CTA?
2. Present a layout menu for the user to choose from:

> **Adapter-aware prompt:**
> **Claude Code (terminal) — REQUIRED:** Call `AskUserQuestion` tool. Only fall back to text menu if the tool errors or is unavailable. AUQ spec:
>   - question: "Which landing page layout fits your goals and audience?"
>   - header: "Layout"
>   - options: [{ label: "Layout A — Hero centric", description: "Hero + trust logos + features + CTA — best for brand awareness and conversions" }, { label: "Layout B — Problem/Solution", description: "Problem/Solution + social proof + pricing + FAQ — best for SaaS sign-ups" }, { label: "Layout C — Product storytelling", description: "Screenshots + testimonials + final CTA — best for product demos" }, { label: "Layout D — SaaS conversion", description: "Integrations + comparison + onboarding steps — best for tool adoption" }]
>   - multiSelect: false
> **Cursor / Codex / Antigravity / other:** use list below

   - Layout A: Hero centric + trust logos + features + CTA
   - Layout B: Problem/Solution + social proof + pricing + FAQ
   - Layout C: Product storytelling + screenshots + testimonials + final CTA
   - Layout D: SaaS conversion + integrations + comparison + onboarding steps
3. Reference `https://21st.dev` to suggest sections/components suited to the chosen layout.
4. Record clearly in the session:
   - Layout the user chose
   - Component candidates from 21st.dev
   - Reason for choice based on objective + audience

### In-session Research Mode
User can request research inline during brainstorm (no skill switch needed):
- Trigger phrases: "research this", "can you research", "need to research", "find best practice"
- When triggered:
  1. Define research scope (1-3 sentences)
  2. Quickly gather from appropriate sources (official docs, reference sites, patterns)
  3. Return a short summary: findings, trade-offs, recommendation
  4. Return to the current brainstorm topic with a proposed decision

If the assistant notices a topic has high ambiguity or risk of a wrong decision, the assistant should proactively suggest:
`This item should be researched quickly before locking in — would you like me to research it now in this session?`

### UI Direction Mode (design-in-the-loop; FEAT-002 + FEAT-007)
If the user is brainstorming a project with UI/UX or requests a visual design:

**Layout — choose one:**

- **Legacy (single screen):** `.viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/index.html` + `style.css` + `notes.md`.
- **Multi-page (multiple screens):** same session directory, add `pages/{slug}.html` for each page; `index.html` is the **hub** (links to every page). `style.css` is shared.

**General rules**

1. Create a direction workspace for the current session (minimum `style.css` + `notes.md`; HTML per chosen layout).
2. Each time the user changes a requirement/layout/component:
   - Update HTML/CSS direction directly
   - Record decision + rationale in `notes.md` (single source of truth for design intent)

### Skill Registry Integration (FEAT-020)

**Trigger**: UI Direction Mode is active (at least one HTML file being generated or updated).

**Step — Load registry:**
```bash
node ~/.claude/viepilot/bin/vp-tools.cjs get-registry 2>/dev/null \
  || node ~/.cursor/viepilot/bin/vp-tools.cjs get-registry 2>/dev/null \
  || cat ~/.viepilot/skill-registry.json 2>/dev/null
```
Parse JSON output → extract `skills[]`.
If output is `null` or command fails: skip silently — no warning, no prompt

**Step — Match skills to UI signals:**
Map brainstorm UI signal keywords to capability tags:

| UI Signal keywords | Capability match |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `component`, `layout`, `screen`, `page`, `UI`, `UX` | `ui-generation`, `component-design` |
| `responsive`, `mobile`, `grid` | `responsive-layout` |
| `design`, `theme`, `color`, `typography` | `design-system`, `design-tokens` |
| `form`, `button`, `input`, `modal` | `component-design` |

For each registered skill: if `skill.capabilities` intersects matched capability tags → skill is **active**.

**Step — Silent apply:**
- For each active skill: prepend `skill.best_practices[]` to the context used for HTML generation
- **No banner, no prompt, no mention to user** — best practices blend into generated output
- This is background-only, like Background UI Extraction (ENH-026)

**Step — Record in notes.md:**
After the session's first UI artifact is generated (or updated), append to `notes.md`:

```yaml
## skills_used
- id: frontend-design
  version: null
  trigger: ui-generation signal
  applied_at: brainstorm-session
  best_practices_applied:
    - Mobile-first
    - Design tokens
```

If `## skills_used` already exists: merge (add new skills, update applied_at).
If no skills matched or registry absent: omit `## skills_used` section.

**Required hook (multi-page only)**

When the `pages/` directory exists or any `pages/*.html` is added / renamed / removed:

- Update the **hub** `index.html` (nav / list of links to all remaining pages).
- Immediately update the **`## Pages inventory`** section in `notes.md` (table: Slug | File | Title | Purpose | Key sections | Nav to) — must match 100% of the current `pages/*.html` file set.
- Do not end a topic / do not consider the UI session “synced” if the inventory diverges from files on disk.

3. If the user sends references/components (including 21st.dev prompts/links), record clearly:
   - reference source
   - the UI area it applies to (page slug if multi-page)
   - adjustments according to product objectives
4. Keep the prototype at a directional description level; do not force production-ready code at the brainstorm stage.

### Recommended Breakdown Ordering (ENH-061)

For sessions that produce both system architecture and UI/UX artifacts, follow this sequence to ensure complete idea→architect+UI breakdown:

```
Step 1: Free idea collection
  → Explore the problem space; no structure required yet

Step 2: Scope lock + Phase assignment  (existing)
  → Assign all features to Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3...
  → Fill ## Phases in session draft

Step 2B: Workspace Mode Selection  (BUG-018)
  → After scope lock, before any design workspace is created
  → AUQ: Both / Architect only / UI Direction only / Neither

Step 3: Feature → Coverage mapping  (ENH-061)
  → For each Phase 1 feature: name the architect component AND UI screen
  → Output: ## Coverage matrix in notes.md

Step 4: Architect Design  (existing — only when Step 2B selects Both or Architect only)
  → Fill architect workspace per coverage matrix
  → Use /vp-brainstorm --architect or let heuristics fire

Step 5: Architect → UI sync  (ENH-061 — arch_to_ui_sync)
  → After architect edits: check which architectural decisions impact UI screens
  → Prompt user to update UI Direction accordingly

Step 6: UI Direction  (existing — only when Step 2B selects Both or UI Direction only)
  → Fill UI workspace per coverage matrix + arch feedback
  → Use /vp-brainstorm --ui or proactive 🎨 banner

Step 7: Completeness gate  (ENH-061)
  → Validate: every Phase 1 feature has ≥1 coverage (architect OR UI)
  → Warn on any feature with no coverage in both modes

Step 8: /save → /vp-crystallize  (existing)
```

> **Note**: Steps 3–7 are optional for simple or early-stage sessions. The flow is recommended when a session produces both Architect Design and UI Direction artifacts.

### Step 2B: Workspace Mode Selection (BUG-018)

Runs **after scope lock** (`## Phases` in session draft is populated) and **before any design workspace is created**.

> **Claude Code (terminal) — REQUIRED:** Call `AskUserQuestion` tool:
> - question: `"Scope locked. Which design workspaces would you like to activate for this session?"`
> - header: `"Workspaces"`
> - options:
>   - `{ label: "Both Architect + UI Direction (Recommended)", description: "Full coverage: architecture HTML workspace + UI prototype direction per ENH-061 Breakdown Ordering" }`
>   - `{ label: "Architect Design only (🏗️)", description: "System architecture, data-flow, ERD, APIs, decisions HTML workspace" }`
>   - `{ label: "UI Direction only (🎨)", description: "HTML prototype direction for screens/pages" }`
>   - `{ label: "Neither — text-only", description: "Continue as text brainstorm, activate workspaces manually later with --architect or --ui" }`
> - multiSelect: false
>
> **Text fallback (Cursor/Codex/Copilot/Antigravity):**
> ```
> Scope locked. Which design workspaces would you like to activate?
> 1. Both Architect + UI Direction (Recommended) — full coverage per ENH-061
> 2. Architect Design only (🏗️) — HTML architecture workspace
> 3. UI Direction only (🎨) — HTML prototype direction
> 4. Neither — text-only, activate manually later
> ```

**On selection:**
- **"Both"**: activate Architect Mode (Step 4) → arch_to_ui_sync (Step 5) → UI Direction (Step 6) — in that order
- **"Architect Design only"**: activate Architect Mode (Step 4), skip Step 6
- **"UI Direction only"**: skip Architect (Step 4), activate UI Direction (Step 6) directly
- **"Neither"**: skip both Steps 4 and 6; user can activate later with `--architect` / `--ui` flag

**Guard rule (BUG-018 fix):**
- Architect auto-activate heuristic (≥3 components / ≥1 stack mention) **MUST NOT fire independently** once Step 2B runs.
- If heuristic fires **before** scope lock: save the signal, defer prompt until Step 2B.
- If user selects **"Neither"** or **"UI Direction only"** at Step 2B: suppress Architect auto-activate for the remainder of this session.
- If user selects **"Architect Design only"** or **"Both"**: heuristic is redundant — workspace activates per selection, no second prompt.

### Architect Design Mode (FEAT-011)

Brainstorm system architecture with live HTML generation — a visual workspace for the user to review, edit, and present before running `/vp-crystallize`.

#### Activation

Activated when **any one** of the following conditions is met:

1. **Explicit flag**: user uses `/vp-brainstorm --architect`
2. **Auto-activate heuristic** (see below)
3. **Architecture topic + complexity threshold**: user selects "Architecture" topic in the brainstorm menu AND (service count ≥3 OR ≥1 tech stack suggestion is made)

**Auto-activate heuristic**: during brainstorm, track:
- **Component/service mentions**: names matching the pattern `{capitalized} Service|API|Module|Layer|Server|Database` (e.g., "UserService", "Payment API", "Data Layer")
- **Stack mentions**: any keyword from the known stack list (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, AWS, Docker, etc.)

When **≥3 components** OR **≥1 stack suggestion** is mentioned → prompt:

```
🏗️ I noticed you are designing an architecture with multiple components.
Activate Architect Design Mode so I can create an HTML visualization?
1. Yes — create workspace and generate initial HTML
2. No — continue text-only
```

- **Option 1 (Yes)**: create workspace (directory + files), generate initial HTML from content already discussed, continue in Architect Mode.
- **Option 2 (No)**: continue text-only brainstorm; heuristic will not prompt again in this session.

#### Workspace layout

```
.viepilot/architect/{session-id}/

```

**Mermaid.js** — all diagrams use: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js">`
- `architecture.html` → `graph TD` or `C4Context`
- `data-flow.html` → `sequenceDiagram` or `flowchart LR`
- `feature-map.html` → `mindmap` or `quadrantChart`
- `erd.html` → `erDiagram` (entities, attributes, relationships)
- `user-use-cases.html` → `flowchart TD` (actors → use case bubbles)
- `sequence-diagram.html` → `sequenceDiagram` (per-scenario step-by-step)
- `deployment.html` → `graph TD` (infra) + `flowchart LR` (CI/CD pipeline)
- `apis.html` → no diagram; endpoint tables with HTTP method badges

#### Page Boundary Rules (ENH-029)

| Page | Use when... |
|------|------------|
| `data-flow.html` | High-level service/event flows — which services talk to which |
| `sequence-diagram.html` | Per-scenario step-by-step interactions with exact message order |
| `architecture.html` | Component structure + C4 system context + external integrations |
| `deployment.html` | Infrastructure, environments, ops concerns, CI/CD pipeline |
| `apis.html` | API endpoint design, HTTP methods, request/response contracts |
| `admin.html` | Admin personas, role hierarchy, key admin operations (CRUD users, billing management, audit log schema), access control model |

#### Admin & Governance Detection (ENH-063)

**Trigger keywords** (case-insensitive, Vietnamese or English):
> `admin`, `administrator`, `back-office`, `quản trị`, `quản lý người dùng`, `user management`, `role`, `permission`, `phân quyền`, `monitor`, `monitoring`, `giám sát`, `audit log`, `audit trail`, `nhật ký`, `billing`, `subscription`, `gói cước`, `thanh toán`, `rate limit`, `quota`, `feature flag`, `feature toggle`, `report`, `reporting`, `báo cáo`, `analytics`, `phân tích`, `SLA`, `compliance`, `GDPR`, `SOC2`, `alert`, `cảnh báo`, `health check`, `observability`

**Early-session detection:**
At session start, scan initial message for admin keywords. If **≥1 keyword** found → show proactive banner:

> **Adapter-aware prompt:**
> **Claude Code (terminal) — REQUIRED:** Call `AskUserQuestion` tool. AUQ spec:
>   - question: "I noticed your project may involve admin or governance capabilities. Should we discuss Admin & Governance (Topic 6)?"
>   - header: "Admin & Governance"
>   - options: [{ label: "Yes — explore admin panel, user management, monitoring, audit logs", description: "Recommended for multi-user/SaaS projects" }, { label: "Not needed — single-user or admin-free project", description: "" }, { label: "Later — add to notes, continue current topic", description: "" }]
>
> **Text fallback:**
> ```
> 🔐 I noticed your project may involve admin or governance capabilities.
> Should we discuss Admin & Governance (Topic 6)?
>
> 1. Yes — explore admin panel, user management, monitoring, audit logs (Recommended for multi-user/SaaS)
> 2. Not needed — single-user or admin-free project
> 3. Later — add to notes, continue current topic
> ```

**During-session detection:**
When **≥2 unique admin keywords** detected → surface confirmation:

> **Claude Code (terminal) — REQUIRED:** Call `AskUserQuestion`:
>   - question: "Admin/governance signals detected in this session. Would you like to cover Admin & Governance (Topic 6)?"
>   - options: [{ label: "Yes — switch to / add admin topic", description: "" }, { label: "Note in background (no topic switch)", description: "" }, { label: "Skip for this session", description: "" }]
>
> **Text fallback:** `🔐 Admin/governance signals detected. Cover Admin & Governance (Topic 6)? 1. Yes 2. Note in background 3. Skip`

**Admin coverage gate before /save:**
Before writing session file, check:
- Project has multi-user signals (`role`, `team`, `organization`) OR
- SaaS/paid product signals (`subscription`, `billing`, `plan`) OR
- Compliance signals (`audit`, `GDPR`, `SOC2`)

If ANY detected AND `## admin` YAML section not present in notes.md:

> **Text fallback:**
> ```
> ⚠️ Admin gap detected: project has multi-user/SaaS/compliance signals but Admin & Governance was not covered.
> 1. Add admin topic now (go to Topic 6)
> 2. Add note to backlog (".viepilot/requests/ENH-admin-tbd.md")
> 3. Dismiss — skip admin for this session
> ```
> (Non-blocking — user can dismiss)

**admin.html trigger:** admin keyword detected in session AND Architect Mode is active → create/update `admin.html`.

#### Sequence trigger keywords (ENH-029)
When the user mentions: `scenario`, `step by step`, `login flow`, `checkout flow`, `detailed interaction`, `sequence`, `interaction diagram` → update `sequence-diagram.html` + update `notes.md ## sequences` section.

#### Deployment trigger keywords (ENH-029)
When the user mentions: `deploy`, `deployment`, `infrastructure`, `infra`, `environment`, `staging`, `production`, `prod`, `AWS`, `GCP`, `Azure`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `k8s`, `CI/CD`, `pipeline`, `server`, `hosting`, `cloud` → update `deployment.html` + update `notes.md ## deployment` section.

#### APIs trigger keywords (ENH-029)
When the user mentions: `endpoint`, `API`, `REST`, `GraphQL`, `gRPC`, `route`, `HTTP`, `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `request`, `response`, `payload`, `auth header` → update `apis.html` + update `notes.md ## apis` section.

#### ERD trigger keywords (ENH-027)
When the user mentions any keyword: `database`, `entity`, `table`, `schema`, `relation`, `relationship`, `foreign key`, `primary key`, `ERD`, `data model`, `normalization` → update `erd.html` + update `notes.md ## erd` section.

#### Use Case trigger keywords (ENH-028)
When the user mentions: `user story`, `use case`, `actor`, `persona`, `as a user`, `user flow`, `workflow`, `journey`, `role`, `permission` → update `user-use-cases.html` + update `notes.md ## use_cases` section.

#### Dialogue cadence

1. After each **major decision** (tech stack, service boundary, data model) → update the related HTML section + update `notes.md`.
2. When the user **changes a decision** → **incremental update**: only edit the related section; keep all other sections unchanged. Add `data-updated="true"` attribute + class `.updated` CSS highlight (yellow left border + "updated" badge) to the changed element.
3. **`/review-arch`** command → ViePilot outputs a summary table of all `decisions` (from `notes.md`) + list of `open_questions` with status; ask the user to confirm before continuing.

#### Incremental update rule

When a decision changes:
- Identify the **related HTML file** (e.g., tech stack change → only edit `tech-stack.html` + `architecture.html`).
- Do **not** regenerate the entire workspace.
- Add `data-updated="true"` to the changed `<section>` or `<tr>`.
- Update `notes.md` YAML (`updated` date + corresponding entry).
- Preserve `decisions.html` history — only add new rows or update the `status` field (do not delete history).

#### Architect Item Actions (ENH-033)

Each item in the Architect HTML workspace has a stable ID in the format `[ARCH:{page-slug}:{item-id}]`
(e.g., `[ARCH:decisions:D1]`, `[ARCH:erd:E2]`, `[ARCH:apis:A4]`).

Two buttons appear on hover next to each item in the HTML:
- **✅ Approve** — copies: `[ARCH:{slug}:{id}] APPROVE — "{title}" on {slug} page. No changes needed.`
- **✏️ Edit** — copies: `[ARCH:{slug}:{id}] EDIT — "{title}" on {slug} page. Current: "{excerpt}". What should I change?`

**When you receive an APPROVE prompt:**
- Confirm the item is accepted as-is.
- Do NOT touch any other item or page.
- Ask if the user wants to continue reviewing other items.

**When you receive an EDIT prompt:**
- Acknowledge the item by its full ID (`[ARCH:{slug}:{id}]`).
- State what the current content is.
- Ask the user what they want to change.
- Apply the change only to that specific item on that specific page.

**ISOLATION RULE — CRITICAL:**
Each action is **strictly scoped** to the named page and item.

- Approving `[ARCH:architecture:C2]` does **NOT** approve any item in `erd`, `apis`, `decisions`, or any other page.
- Editing `[ARCH:decisions:D1]` does **NOT** trigger updates to `architecture`, `erd`, or any other page unless the user explicitly asks for cross-page follow-up.
- **Never infer or cascade approval/edit across pages.** Each page is an independent artifact namespace.
- Cross-page impacts (e.g., "this decision affects the ERD") must come from a **separate, explicit** user prompt after the first action is complete.

### Background UI Extraction (silent mode) — ENH-026

Runs **silently** in every brainstorm session (no `--ui` flag required). Does not interrupt the main conversation.

#### Signal keywords
When the assistant detects any keyword (case-insensitive, Vietnamese or English) in the user's message or session summary:

> `màu`, `màu sắc`, `color`, `layout`, `màn hình`, `screen`, `page`, `trang`, `button`, `nút`, `form`, `biểu mẫu`, `mobile`, `responsive`, `giao diện`, `UI`, `UX`, `design`, `dashboard`, `sidebar`, `header`, `footer`, `modal`, `popup`, `icon`, `theme`, `typography`, `font`, `spacing`, `grid`, `card`, `component`, `hero`, `banner`

#### Early-session detection (ENH-060)
At the very start of a brainstorm session, scan the user's **initial message** for UI/UX signal keywords. If **≥1 keyword** is found, show the proactive activation banner **immediately** (before topic selection):

```
🎨 I noticed your project involves UI/UX design.
Would you like to activate UI Direction Mode? I can generate an HTML prototype direction alongside our brainstorm.

1. Yes — activate UI Direction Mode (create .viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/)
2. Save ideas to notes only (background, no HTML yet)
3. No — continue brainstorm without UI Direction
```

This mirrors **Architect Design Mode** which proactively banners when system architecture heuristics fire.

#### Threshold & accumulation rule
- **Count unique keyword occurrences** during the ongoing session.
- When **≥1 signal occurrence** is detected: begin **silent accumulation** — record UI ideas into a `ui_idea_buffer[]` in the session context.
- **Non-blocking**: does not interrupt the main conversation, does not ask for user confirmation immediately.
- Each buffer entry records: keyword trigger, utterance context (short summary ≤20 words).

#### Surface triggers (when to ask the user)
Display a confirmation dialogue when any of the following conditions occur:
- (a) **Topic ends** — user types `/topic` to switch to a new topic or says "next"
- (b) **User types `/save` or `/review`**
- (c) **≥2 unique signals accumulated** in the buffer

#### Confirmation dialogue template
```
🎨 I noticed UI/UX design ideas in this session:
- {idea 1 extracted from buffer}
- {idea 2 extracted from buffer}
...

Would you like to activate UI Direction Mode?
1. Save to .viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/notes.md (background, no HTML yet)
2. Save + activate UI Direction Mode (create .viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/, generate HTML direction)
3. No — discard and continue brainstorming
```

**Option 1**: Write `## Background extracted ideas` to `.viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/notes.md` (create file/directory if not yet present). Clear buffer. Continue.

**Option 2**: Write to notes.md (same as Option 1) **+ fully trigger the `### UI Direction Mode` workflow** (create `index.html`, `style.css`). Clear buffer. Continue in UI Direction Mode.

**Option 3**: Keep buffer unchanged (do not clear, do not write). Continue brainstorm. Re-surface at the next trigger.

#### Auto-write path (Option 1 + 2)
```bash
mkdir -p .viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}
# Append to notes.md (create if missing):
# ## Background extracted ideas
# - {idea from buffer, with source context}
```

### UI Direction — UX walkthrough & upgrade (FEAT-010)

When inside **`/vp-brainstorm --ui`** or a `.viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/` already exists for the current session, the user can invoke:

- **`/research-ui`** — runs the full pipeline below
- **`/research ui`** — **alias** of `/research-ui` (space after `research`; does not conflict with `/research {free topic}`)

The user can include one line of context (e.g., product name **Trips**, persona, priority flow) — entered in the same message as the command.

Apply **the phases sequentially** (assistant does not skip a phase unless the user explicitly says “phase 1 only”):

#### Phase 1 — Simulate end user

1. Role-play as the **end user** using the prototype (get app name / main screen from `notes.md`, HTML, or user prompt).
2. List **3–8 specific scenarios** (e.g., first app launch, completing the main task, edge case errors) — prioritize the correct page if multi-page (`pages/*.html`).
3. For each scenario: describe **behavior** (imagined reading/clicking on the current UI) → record **pain**: ambiguity, missing feedback, too many steps, mismatch with mental model, mobile/a11y concerns, etc.
4. Synthesize **Voice of pseudo-user** (bullets + severity **low / medium / high**).
5. **Content stress & layout overflow pass (content stress pass)** — *required in every `/research-ui` run*: after happy/edge behavior, simulate **boundary data** on each key screen/page (or the full hub if single-screen). Consider at minimum **3–6 of the following categories** (choose those relevant to product context; skip inapplicable ones but **note “N/A + reason”**):
   - **Long copy**: headline, subtitle, CTA, input placeholder, tooltip, breadcrumb, long place/person names (Unicode), long emails/URLs.
   - **Volume**: lists/grids with **many elements**, multi-column/row tables, stacked tags/badges, notification stacks, calendars with many events.
   - **Numbers & formats**: very large/small monetary values, long units, time zones/locales (if the product supports them).
   - **Error / validation states**: long error messages, multiple simultaneous errors, inline + banner.
   - **Empty vs fully packed**: no data vs max items; skeleton vs flash of long content.
   - **Viewport**: same stress on **narrow** (mobile) and **wide** (desktop) if the prototype targets multiple screen sizes.

   **Stress recipes by archetype (ENH-020)** — after applying the checklist above, **lock in 1–2 archetypes** that match the product (from `notes.md` / HTML / user) and apply **at least two recipes** from each selected row (may be rephrased in the session language; **note the archetype** in Stress findings):

   | Archetype | Stress priorities (suggested recipes) | Notes |
   |-----------|---------------------------------------|-------|
   | **Landing / marketing** | Hero **headline** very short vs very long; **pricing** 3–5 tiers + long feature list per tier; **FAQ** 10–20 items (accordion/stack); **logo / social proof** row of 8–15 logos + long names | Sticky CTA vs long content; section order when overflow |
   | **App shell / SaaS admin** | **Table** many columns + many rows; **filter bar** chip + dropdown overflow; **sidebar** multi-level; **notification** stack / toast overlap | Dense vs comfortable state; frozen column |
   | **Form-heavy / wizard** | Long **label + hint**; **multi-step** 5–7 steps + long breadcrumb; **errors** inline per field + global banner; expandable **optional fields** block | Tab order, submit disabled ambiguity |
   | **Content / reader** | Very long **article**; wide **code block**; **TOC** 20–40 headings; **related** 8–15 cards | Max line length, sidenote, mobile reading |
   | **Commerce / booking / marketplace** | Dense search results **grid**; **price** + long unit + discount; **date/time** + time zone + DST; **seat/room booking** + long availability text | Cart / summary on mobile |

   Hybrid (e.g., marketing + app): **merge recipes** from relevant rows; avoid repeating the same meaningless stress on two identical screens.

   For prototypes with only short sample content: **no requirement** to edit files immediately in Phase 1 — instead **describe assumptions** (“if the title is 120 characters…”) and how the UI would **overflow, ellipsis, scroll, overlap, wrap poorly**.
6. Also synthesize **Stress findings** (bullets: stress type → observation → severity **low/medium/high**) and merge into the Phase 1 summary for Phase 2.

#### Phase 2 — UX designer + research

1. Switch role: **UX/UI designer** receiving feedback from Phase 1 (**including Stress findings**).
2. Map pain → **design root cause** (short heuristic, missing/incorrect pattern); **prioritize** P0 / P1 / P2 — **prioritize P0** if content stress causes **information loss, mis-clicks, or unusability** (overflow covering CTA, truncated meaningful text, table overflow unreadable).
3. **Web research**: when benchmarking or industry-standard patterns are needed, run **1–3 queries** (search) → summarize source, takeaway, trade-off.
4. **Propose specific improvements** (UI components, copy, layout, flow) tied to file/page (`slug` if multi-page).

#### Phase 3 — Update artifacts

1. Edit **`index.html`**, **`pages/*.html`**, **`style.css`** per P0 → P1 within the session scope (prototype direction, no forcing production code).
2. In **`notes.md`**, add or append a **`## UX walkthrough log`** section (one entry per command run): date/scenarios simulated, main pains, **Stress findings** (summary), research links (if any), **intent diff** (bullets), files changed. *Optional:* adjust HTML with **long placeholder/copy** or add a **demo row** to illustrate stress discussed (record in log).
3. **Multi-page**: after editing a page, keep **`## Pages inventory`** and the **hub** matching 100% of files in `pages/*` (hook FEAT-007).

**Relationship with `/research {topic}`**: the **free-form** command only needs a quick research and return to topic; **`/research-ui`** requires **3 phases** + **log entry** + **HTML/CSS edits when proposals are reasonable**.

User reference: `docs/user/features/ui-direction.md`.

### End of each topic
- Summarize decisions
- List action items
- Note open questions
- If the topic adds/changes a capability: update **`## Phases`** in the session draft (or remind the user to `/save`) with the appropriate phase
</step>

<step name="project_meta_intake">
## 5. Project meta intake (FEAT-009)

Normative contract: **`docs/dev/global-profiles.md`** (`~/.viepilot/profiles/`, `~/.viepilot/profile-map.md`, `.viepilot/META.md`).

### 5.1 When this step runs

Runs **before** saving the session in **`Completed`** status or when the user types **`/end`**, **if**:

1. **Scope locked**: `## Phases` in the session draft already contains real content (all features assigned to a phase) **or** the user has just verbally confirmed scope is finalized.
2. **Binding missing**: `.viepilot/META.md` does not exist **or** the frontmatter lacks a valid `viepilot_profile_id` (slug `kebab-case` per contract).

**Skip by default** (skip intake) when `.viepilot/META.md` already has a valid `viepilot_profile_id` — only ask quickly: *”Keep profile `{id}`? Change profile?”*; if kept → proceed to Save step.

### 5.2 Prepare registry

1. `mkdir -p "$HOME/.viepilot/profiles"` if needed.
2. Read `~/.viepilot/profile-map.md` if present to list existing profiles (profile_id, display_name, org_tag).

### 5.3 Disambiguation (multiple profiles / multiple orgs)

- If the brainstorm reveals **multiple orgs/clients** or **≥2 rows in profile-map** match the suggestion (same `org_tag` or tag): **require** the user to select **one** `profile_id` **or** choose **Create new profile** (new slug, not yet existing).

### 5.4 Sequential Q&A (one question per turn)

For each question:

1. Provide a short **Proposal** (1–2 sentences) inferred from the session + phase plan.
2. User responds **Accept proposal** / **Edit** (record user's version).
3. Move to the next question.

**At minimum** these must be clarified before writing the file (matches body sections in the global contract):

| Order | Question (suggested) | Maps to |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| 1 | Display name for org/client or “personal”? | `display_name` |
| 2 | Short `org_tag` (e.g., `acme`, `personal`)? | `org_tag` |
| 3 | Branding / voice (audience, tone)? | body `## Branding & voice` |
| 4 | Public legal / attribution (if any)? | body `## Legal & attribution` |
| 5 | Public website (optional)? | frontmatter `website` |

Then: finalize **`profile_id`** = slug filename (`kebab-case`).

### 5.5 Write artifacts (machine + project)

1. **`~/.viepilot/profiles/<slug>.md`**: YAML frontmatter with all required keys (`profile_id`, `display_name`, `org_tag`, `tags`, `last_updated`) + body sections collected. Do **not** write secrets.
2. **`~/.viepilot/profile-map.md`**: add or update a table row (columns per contract); update `last_used` = current date.
3. **`.viepilot/META.md`**: create/update from `templates/project/VIEPILOT-META.md` with `viepilot_profile_id: <slug>`.

### 5.6 Record in session file

In the draft / session file, add section:

```markdown
## Project meta intake (FEAT-009)
- **status**: completed | skipped
- **profile_id**: {slug}
- **profile_path**: ~/.viepilot/profiles/{slug}.md
- **binding**: .viepilot/META.md
```

If skipped (rare): must have a **`## Meta intake waiver`** in the same session file with the **reason** provided by the user.

### 5.7 Continue

After intake is **completed** or a **valid skip** (META already has profile) → proceed to **step 6 — Save Session**.
</step>

<step name="save_session">
## 6. Save Session

### Pre-Save Phase Assignment Validation (ENH-052)

Before writing the session file, validate phase assignment completeness:

**Scope-locked session** — `## Phases` section exists with real content OR user confirmed scope finalized (ref: Step 5.1 condition 1):

```
CHECK 1: Does session draft contain a non-empty ## Phases section?
CHECK 2: Does Phase 1 have at least one feature/capability assigned?
CHECK 3: Are there any features listed outside a phase (unassigned)?
CHECK 4 (ENH-061): If both Architect workspace AND UI Direction workspace are active —
         does ## Coverage in notes.md have any Phase 1 feature with "none yet" in BOTH columns?
```

**Gate condition:**
- If scope is locked AND (CHECK 1 fails OR CHECK 2 fails):
  → **Block save.** Show:
  ```
  ⚠️  Phase assignment incomplete — cannot save as Completed.

  Features were discussed but no phase assignments exist.
  Before saving:
    1. Assign all features to phases (## Phases section)
    2. Ensure Phase 1 has at least one feature

  Return to the conversation to assign phases, then /save again.
  ```
- If scope is **not** locked (exploratory session — no feature assignments):
  → **Allow save** with `Status: In Progress` and add advisory note to session file:
  ```markdown
  > ⚠️ Exploratory session — no phase assignments yet.
  > Run /vp-brainstorm to continue and assign features to phases before /vp-crystallize.
  ```
- If CHECK 4 fires (both workspaces active + uncovered Phase 1 features): **non-blocking warning**:
  ```
  ⚠️  Coverage gap detected — these Phase 1 features have no Architect or UI coverage:
  - {feature name}
  Consider running /sync-ui or adding these features to a workspace before /vp-crystallize.
  Proceed with save? (yes / skip coverage for now)
  ```
- If brownfield stub session (`IS_BROWNFIELD=true`): **skip this gate** — brownfield stubs intentionally have no phases.
- If all checks pass → proceed to Feature → Coverage Mapping check, then file write.

### Feature → Coverage Mapping (ENH-061)

**Trigger**: After phase assignment checks pass and before file write. Runs when the session has BOTH Architect workspace AND UI Direction workspace active, or when `## Coverage` already exists in notes.md.

For each feature/capability listed under **Phase 1** in the session draft, identify:
- **Architect coverage**: which architect page handles this? (`architecture`, `data-flow`, `erd`, `apis`, `tech-stack`, `decisions`, `user-use-cases`, `sequence-diagram`, `deployment`, or `none yet`)
- **UI coverage**: which UI screen/page handles this? (page slug, `index.html`, or `none yet`)

Output a `## Coverage` section in `notes.md`:

```markdown
## Coverage
| Feature | Architect page | UI screen |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| User authentication | architecture, apis | login.html, register.html |
| Dashboard overview | data-flow | dashboard.html |
| Notification system | architecture | none yet |
```

**Warning rules (non-blocking)**:
- If a Phase 1 feature has `none yet` in **both** columns:
  `⚠️ Feature "{name}" has no coverage in Architect or UI Direction. Consider adding it to a workspace before /vp-crystallize.`
- If Architect workspace exists but coverage matrix is empty: suggest running coverage mapping.
- User can dismiss with "skip coverage" or "fill in later" — does **not** block save.

## 6C. Architect → UI Direction Sync (ENH-061)

Bridges the gap from **Architect Design** → **UI Direction** — the reverse of `architect_delta_sync` (ENH-034, which syncs UI → Architect).

When the architect workspace is updated (any page edit during the session), scan the changed content for decisions that carry **UI implications**:

### Architectural decisions that trigger UI updates

| Architect signal | UI implication to check |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Async / event-driven flow | Loading states, optimistic updates, error handling screens |
| API pagination | Pagination component, empty state, scroll-to-load |
| Auth roles / permissions | Conditional UI rendering, role-specific screens |
| Rate limiting / quota | Warning banners, upgrade prompts, disabled states |
| Real-time → polling fallback | Refresh indicators, stale data warnings |
| File size / type constraints | Upload validation, error messages, progress indicators |
| Third-party OAuth / SSO | Redirect flow, consent screen, token expiry handling |
| Error codes from APIs | Error state screens, retry affordances |
| Data constraints (max length, required fields) | Form validation UI, helper text |

### Trigger conditions
`arch_to_ui_sync` fires when:
- The user edits any architect workspace page during an active brainstorm session that also has a UI Direction workspace
- User types `/sync-ui` (manual trigger, parallel to `/sync-arch`)
- After `/review-arch` if changes were applied

### Output format
```
🎨 Architect → UI sync — detected implications:

From `data-flow.html` (async notification queue):
  → UI may need: notification badge with unread count, real-time update indicator, empty state
  → Affected screens: dashboard.html (not yet modeled in UI Direction)

Update UI Direction to reflect these decisions?
1. Yes — open UI Direction and address these screens/states now
2. Note it in notes.md (## arch_to_ui_sync) for later
3. Skip — already handled
```

### Manual command
`/sync-ui` — manually trigger arch_to_ui_sync from the current architect session state. If no UI Direction workspace is active, suggest activating it first.

When `/sync-ui` is used and no implications are found:
`✓ No UI Direction implications detected from current architect changes.`

### notes.md record
Append to `notes.md` when action is taken:
```yaml
## arch_to_ui_sync
- architect_page: data-flow.html
  decision: async notification queue
  ui_implication: unread count badge, empty state, real-time update indicator
  status: noted | addressed | skipped
  date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

### Cross-workspace HUB links (ENH-064)

When BOTH architect AND ui-direction workspaces are active in the same session:
After `arch_to_ui_sync` completes (or when both workspaces first become active together):

**Update Architect `index.html`** — add to nav/header section:
```html
<div class="cross-workspace-link">
  <a href="../../ui-direction/{session-id}/index.html" target="_blank">
    🎨 View UI Direction workspace
  </a>
</div>
```

**Update UI Direction `index.html`** — add to nav/header section:
```html
<div class="cross-workspace-link">
  <a href="../../architect/{session-id}/index.html" target="_blank">
    🏗️ View Architect workspace
  </a>
</div>
```

**Trigger conditions:**
- After arch_to_ui_sync fires (ENH-061)
- When BUG-018 Step 2B selection is "Both" and both workspaces are created
- Manual: user types `/sync-links`

**Relative path calculation:**
- From `.viepilot/architect/{session-id}/index.html` → `../../ui-direction/{session-id}/index.html`
- From `.viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/index.html` → `../../architect/{session-id}/index.html`
- Use the same `{session-id}` (same date YYYY-MM-DD) for cross-linking.

</step>

<step name="architect_delta_sync">
## 6B. Architect Delta Sync (ENH-034)

Bridges the gap between UI Direction Mode and the Architect HTML workspace.
When a UI brainstorm session surfaces architect-relevant gaps or changes, those
deltas are parsed and written back to the relevant architect HTML template files.

### Trigger conditions

Runs when **either** condition is met:

1. **End of UI session** — `.viepilot/ui-direction/{session-id}/` exists for the current
   session AND the session contains ≥1 architect keyword hit detected during UI discussion
   (see keyword lists below).
2. **Manual command** — user types `/sync-arch` at any point in a session.

> **Automatic mode (FEAT-012):** If the brainstorm staleness hook is installed
> (`vp-tools hooks install`), stale architect items are flagged automatically after
> **each AI response** — no need to type `/sync-arch`. The hook marks items
> `data-arch-stale="true"` (amber badge) without rewriting content. Install once per machine.
> See `docs/user/features/hooks.md` for setup.

When neither condition is met: skip silently.
When `/sync-arch` is used explicitly and no gaps are found: output
`✓ No architect gaps detected in this session.`

### Step 1: Locate architect session

```bash
ls .viepilot/architect/ 2>/dev/null
```

- Find `.viepilot/architect/{session-id}/` matching the current session context
  (same date, same project name, or most recent).
- If **no architect workspace exists**: skip with message:
  `⚠ No architect workspace found. Run /vp-brainstorm --architect first to create one.`

### Step 2: Gap detection — scan session for architect keywords by page

Use the **existing trigger keyword lists** from Architect Design Mode (defined above) to
identify which architect pages are affected:

| Page | Keywords (excerpt) |
|------|--------------------|
| `architecture.html` | service, component, module, layer, boundary, system, integration, C4 |
| `erd.html` | database, entity, table, schema, relation, foreign key, ERD, data model |
| `apis.html` | endpoint, API, REST, route, HTTP, POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, request, response |
| `deployment.html` | deploy, infrastructure, environment, staging, production, CI/CD, pipeline |
| `data-flow.html` | data flow, event flow, queue, webhook, async, pub/sub |
| `user-use-cases.html` | user story, use case, actor, persona, as a user, user flow, journey |
| `sequence-diagram.html` | sequence, step by step, login flow, checkout flow, interaction |

For each page where **≥1 keyword is found in the UI brainstorm session output**:
- Mark as **affected**.
- Extract the relevant sentences/paragraphs that describe the gap or change.

### Step 3: Update HTML for each affected page

For each affected page:

1. **Read** `.viepilot/architect/{session-id}/{page}.html`
2. **Identify the target element(s)**:
   - Match the gap context to the nearest `<tr data-arch-id="...">` row or
     `<div class="card" data-arch-id="...">` by comparing gap keywords to the
     item's `data-arch-title` or first cell content.
   - If no exact match: add a **new row** to the relevant `<tbody>` (the most
     appropriate table for the content type) with the gap information.
3. **Update element content**:
   - For existing rows: update the relevant `<td>` cell with the new/corrected
     information from the brainstorm.
   - For new rows: create `<tr data-arch-id="{PAGE-PREFIX-NEW{n}}"
     data-updated="true" class="updated">` with content from the brainstorm.
4. **Mark as updated**: add `data-updated="true"` and `class="updated"` to the
   changed element (uses existing `.updated` CSS — yellow left border + badge).
5. **Add sync note**: add `data-arch-sync-note="{brief reason, ≤60 chars}"` to the
   changed element recording why it was updated.

**Do NOT**:
- Change elements that were NOT identified as gaps.
- Cascade updates across pages (isolation rule — ENH-033 applies here too).
- Remove existing data — only update or add.

### Step 4: Record delta in notes.md

Append under `## architect_sync` section in `.viepilot/architect/{session-id}/notes.md`:

```yaml
## architect_sync
- synced_at: {ISO datetime}
  source_session: {ui-direction session-id}
  trigger: {end-of-session | /sync-arch}
  changes:
    - page: {slug}
      item_id: {data-arch-id}
      action: {updated | added}
      change: "{brief description of what was updated, ≤80 chars}"
    - page: {slug}
      item_id: {data-arch-id}
      action: updated
      change: "{description}"
```

### Step 5: Output sync report

```
🔄 Architect Sync complete

Updated {N} items across {M} pages:
  {page}    {item-id} [{action}] — {change}
  ...

Items marked with data-updated="true" in architect workspace.
Open .viepilot/architect/{session-id}/ to review changes.
```

If only 1 item changed: single-line summary is sufficient.

### notes.md schema update

The `## architect_sync` section is **appended** (not replaced) on each sync run.
Multiple sync entries can exist — each with its own `synced_at` timestamp.

✓ Brainstorm session saved

Summary:
- Topics covered: {count}
- Decisions made: {count}
- Open questions: {count}

Next step: /vp-crystallize
This will transform your brainstorm into:
- Project structure
- Architecture documents
- Development roadmap (phases + tasks from `## Phases` section)
```
</step>

</process>

<commands>
User can use the following commands during a brainstorm session:

- `/topic {name}` - Switch to a new topic
- `/summary` - View current session summary
- `/save` - Save progress immediately
- `/end` - End and save the session (after **step 5 — Project meta intake** when binding is missing; see workflow)
- `/questions` - View list of open questions
- `/research {topic}` - Quick research inline in the session and return to current topic
- `/research-ui` — UX walkthrough: simulate user → designer + research → update UI direction + log (`notes.md`) — only when a UI session exists (FEAT-010)
- `/research ui` — alias of `/research-ui`
- `/review-arch` — Architect Mode: output summary table of decisions + open_questions from `notes.md`, confirm before continuing (FEAT-011)
- `/sync-arch` — Architect Delta Sync (ENH-034): manually trigger architect HTML sync from current UI brainstorm session; scans session for architect gaps → updates relevant architect workspace pages
- `/sync-ui` — Architect → UI Direction Sync (ENH-061): manually trigger arch_to_ui_sync; scans architect workspace for decisions that carry UI implications and prompts UI Direction updates
- `/hooks-install` — Install the brainstorm staleness hook (FEAT-012): runs `vp-tools hooks install`; one-time setup per machine; auto-marks stale architect items after each AI response
